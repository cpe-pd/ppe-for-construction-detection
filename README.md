## üìì About
This is the official repository of our PPE detection application for construction which is part of the whole system in our capstone project. It analyzes the detected PPE from camera stream and evaluates the violations of each person. We also used an API that predicts their identities using [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition). When obtaining the output from the detection, it will be wrapped up as a message to be published and sent as a payload which will then be received by multiple clients that are connected in the broker through lightweight messaging protocol called [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Design
We used a Rasperry Pi 4 Model B and an OKdo camera module in this project. Additionally, we included some minor components to 
help the user determine the status of the device and physically turn it off. These components are: RGB LED light, piezo buzzer, and a 
tactile switch. A tripod can also be attached and detached to the bottom of the enclosure to adjust the angle of the camera, 
which aids the mobility of the device. The ventillation also plays a vital role in the every hardware. Therefore, in the enclosure, 
the exhausts are found at the top, right, and left.

## üîç Model Classes
The trained model covers eleven classes. It can detect compliant and noncompliant PPE for construction, it can also detect persons which aids the application to determine particular violations.
<ul>
  <li>Helmet</li>
  <li>No Helmet</li>
  <li>Glasses</li>
  <li>No Glasses</li>
  <li>Vest</li>
  <li>No Vest</li>
  <li>Gloves</li>
  <li>No Gloves</li>
  <li>Boots</li>
  <li>No Boots</li>
  <li>Person</li>
</ul>

## üìä Datasets
The trained model was trained using these datasets with different image augmentation. The custom dataset used in this project were pre-processed and thoroughly scanned and labeled following the classes mentioned above. Images were resized to 640x640 and provided with different augmentations. The final datasets are split into three different sets 70% Training Set, 20% Validation Set, and 10% Testing Set.

The datasets are available in these links:
<ul>
  <li>

</ul>

## üöÄ Installation
To get started, install the required dependencies. It is highly recommended to use virtual environment ([Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/), [Virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/)) to isolate them to the system. 

There are some external dependencies that are not included in the script. Download and install them first before continuing to the next step. 

After that, just run this script and it will handle the installation.
```bash
./scripts/linux/install.sh
```

Download and install mosquitto from https://mosquitto.org/download/. Make sure to set it as a service to automatically start itself during system startup. There should be username and password set up in the configuration by creating a password file (e.g. `passwd_file`):
```bash
# Uncomment the following values in this configuration file: mosquitto.conf

listener 1883
password_file passwd_file
allow_anonymous false
```
To create a username and password, enter this command:
```bash
# Note: `admin` is a username, you can change it if you want
# After entering this command, it will prompt for a password
mosquitto_passwd passwd_file admin
```
This is optional, but if you want to run the broker manually instead of a service, then run this command:
```
mosquitto -c mosquitto.conf -v
```

## üé¶ Demonstration
We are currently doing some tests on various construction sites to determine the quality of the system and draw conclusions about the accomplished objectives, particularly the accuracy of detection.
