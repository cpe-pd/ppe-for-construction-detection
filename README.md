# Web API Server with PPE Detection for Construction Safety
This is the official repository of our web api server, whicih is part of the whole system in our prototype on project design. The server act as the gateway for communication between Raspberry Pi and mobile application. It provides information about the detected PPE worker violators and they could be requested by the mobile application through HTTP via RESTful API.
